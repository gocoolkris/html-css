# Html tags
We start with reviewing six tags initially. They are the most commonly used ones in day to day life and real-world
applications. A good habit to do is to indent the tags/text while writing html code that facilitates the ease of readability.

## Tags
We are primarily concerned with these tags
  * anchor - &lt;a&gt;
  * paragraph - &lt;p&gt;
  * headers - &lt;h1&gt;..&lt;h6&gt;
  * lists - &lt;ul&gt;/&lt;ol&gt;/&lt;li&gt;
  * strong - &lt;strong&gt;
  * blockquote - &lt;blockquote&gt;
  * linebreaks - &lt;hr&gt;/&lt;br&gt;
  
## Generic Tags
We use some special tags that itself does not facilitate the content viewing, but allows easy manipulation of the 
size, location or positioning of the content inside it. 
  * div - &lt;div&gt;
  * span - &lt;span&gt;
The div tag allows the content inside it to be wrapped as a container(the default value of 'display' attribute is
'block), while span does not come with that attribute. 

## Simplification in HTML5
Since, most of the pages had div tags that are utilized for header, footer and content, the writers of HTML5
decided to introduce new tags that simplify/reduce the number of div tags. 
  * Header - &lt;header&gt; Typically used for header section which in-turn can contain other tags like nav, img, a etc.
  * Footer - &lt;footer&gt; Typically used for the footer section including the copyright information etc.
  * Navigation - &lt;nav&gt; Typically encompasses set of anchor tags. 
  * Main - &lt;main&gt; Typically used for main content of the page in context.
  * Aside - &lt;aside&gt; When there are content to be split on left and right, this tag comes in handy.
  * article, details, figcaption, figure, mark, section, summary, time.
